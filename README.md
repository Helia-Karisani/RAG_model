# RAG model and Medical Data Processing and Output Project

This project is designed to process JSON files and provide outputs through a website. Below is an overview of the project structure and execution instructions.

## Features
- **Replication:** Generate outputs similar to the original data.
- **Parsing CSV files:** Process and analyze CSV files for data preparation.
- **Prompt creation for LLMs:** Generate input prompts for large language models.
- **Flask Web Application:** Provide a simple user interface for the project.
- **HTML and CSS Design:** Enhance the user interface and experience.

## Important Links
- Future website for additional functionality and data outputs: [Patient Portal - Builder Preview](https://patient-portal-yrdq1xv3y4hn074m.builder-preview.com/)
- Current website for uploading patient JSON data and receiving summarized patient information: [Patient Portal - Render](https://helia-patient-portal.onrender.com)

## Main Project Files
- **`app.py`:** The primary script that runs the project and displays data on the website. This file is also available on GitHub.
- **`analysis_5.py`:** A script that extracts data from any JSON file and saves it in an Excel file. By default, it processes files ending with `fixed`.

## Auxiliary Files
- Files starting with `analysis` and containing numbers less than 5 are auxiliary and were used during the initial stages of the project. They are kept for reference but are not essential to the final project.
- JSON files with names containing `parse` are generated by the main script for use in the project.
- JSON data files are the main provided datasets and consist of only three files.

## How to Run
To run the main script that provides outputs on the website:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Execute the `app.py` file.

## Steps to Deploy the Flask App

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository
Run the following commands in your project directory to initialize the Git repository:
```bash
git init
```
This creates an empty Git repository.

---

### 2. Add and Commit Project Files
Add all project files (e.g., `app.py`, `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, templates, and static files) to the Git staging area and commit the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Flask app"
```

After this, the project structure might look like:
```
Procfile
app.py
requirements.txt
static/style.css
templates/index.html
templates/results.html
```

---

### 3. Set Up the Remote Repository on GitHub
Connect the local repository to a GitHub repository:
```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Helia-Karisani/helia-patient-portal.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 4. Update the Code and Add More Features
For subsequent changes (e.g., adding pages or fixing bugs), follow these steps:
- Add new files or make edits.
- Stage and commit the changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Description of the change"
  ```
- Push the changes to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

Example commits:
- Adding new pages:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Adding more pages to patient portal"
  ```
- Fixing box sizes:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "box size fix"
  ```
- Updating text:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "md text fix"
  ```

---

### 5. Create a Procfile
The `Procfile` specifies how the application should be run. For this Flask app, the `Procfile` contains:
```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

---

### 6. Define Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
List all the required Python libraries. For example:
```
Flask==3.1.0
gunicorn==23.0.0
pandas==2.2.3
openai==1.59.7
```

---

### 7. Deploy to Render
1. Log in to Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Render.
3. Render will:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Use the `Procfile` to run the application.

---

### 8. Monitor Deployment Logs
Use the Render dashboard to monitor the build and deployment process. For example:
```
==> Uploading build...
==> Build uploaded in 8s
==> Build successful ðŸŽ‰
==> Deploying...
==> Running 'gunicorn app:app'
```

---

### 9. Access the Application
Once deployed, access the application at the provided URL. Example:
- **Current Website**: [Patient Portal](https://helia-patient-portal.onrender.com)

---

## Additional Notes
- The project uses the `main` branch to track and push all updates.
- Changes to files can be committed and pushed as needed for incremental improvements.
