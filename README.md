# RAG model and Medical Data Processing and Output Project

This project is designed to process JSON files and provide outputs through a website. Below is an overview of the project structure and execution instructions.

## Features
- **Replication:** Generate outputs similar to the original data.
- **Parsing CSV files:** Process and analyze CSV files for data preparation.
- **Prompt creation for LLMs:** Generate input prompts for large language models.
- **Flask Web Application:** Provide a simple user interface for the project.
- **HTML and CSS Design:** Enhance the user interface and experience.

## Important Links
- Future website for additional functionality and data outputs: [Patient Portal - Builder Preview](https://patient-portal-yrdq1xv3y4hn074m.builder-preview.com/)
- Current website for uploading patient JSON data and receiving summarized patient information: [Patient Portal - Render](https://helia-patient-portal.onrender.com)

## Main Project Files
- **`app.py`:** The primary script that runs the project and displays data on the website. This file is also available on GitHub.
- **`analysis_5.py`:** A script that extracts data from any JSON file and saves it in an Excel file. By default, it processes files ending with `fixed`.

## Auxiliary Files
- Files starting with `analysis` and containing numbers less than 5 are auxiliary and were used during the initial stages of the project. They are kept for reference but are not essential to the final project.
- JSON files with names containing `parse` are generated by the main script for use in the project.
- JSON data files are the main provided datasets and consist of only three files.

## How to Run
To run the main script that provides outputs on the website:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Execute the `app.py` file.
